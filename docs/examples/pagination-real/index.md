# Pagination RealList

RealList By [apathia1220](https://github.com/apathia1220) Contribution Codeï¼š

- Pagination: The list data is divided into upper and lower pages, always caching only the current page data and buffered data (for example, when pageSize is 20, the cached data is 40)

- RealList: All cached data is rendered realistically
